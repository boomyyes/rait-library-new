#### **HOW TO RUN:**

open CMD and change directory to directory "backend"

run index.js to connect to MongoDB



open another CMD (change directory to where you have mongoDB locally downloaded)

run mongod.exe

open another CMD in the same directory

run mongosh.exe

This will get your database up and running

in the third terminal, change your database to "raitLibrary" if needed, by using this command: ` use raitLibrary `



IMPORTANT: KEEP THE SECOND AND THIRD TERMINALS OPEN AT ALL TIMES, if closed MongoDB will CLOSE



open one last terminal in the directory of the project folder i.e "rait-library-new"

run this command: ` npm start ` to start the react app



the react app should be then fully functional.
